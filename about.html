        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. Took the midnight train
          going anywhere. Met a small town boy, born and raised in South Detroit,
          he took the midnight train going anywhere. Strangers, waiting, up and down the
          boulevard and shadows, searching in the night. Streetlights, people, living just
          to find emotion, hiding somewhere in the night.</p>
          <p>I wear short skirts, I wear t-shirts. I'm cheer captain, AND I'm on the bleachers.
            I'm dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for
            (in a photographer) has been here the whole time.</p>
          <p>I'm good at wasting time, I think lyrics neeed to rhyme. And you're not asking,
            but I'm trying to (get my boyfriend) to grow a mustache. I eat cheese, but only on
            pizza, please, and sometimes on a homemade quesillda, otherwise it smells
            like feet to me.</p>
