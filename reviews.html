        <h2>Raya is great!</h2>
        <p>Raya is awesome. She took my wedding pictures and I absolutely loved
          the outcome! She was spunky, fun, energetic, and very talented! I
          would totally recommend and use her again!</p>

          <h2>Always so fun</h2>
          <p>I love her. She is so awesome. When you take pictures with her, she makes you feel
           like a million bucks. She's prepared with anything, even snacks for the kids.
           If you're looking for a photographer, she is your gal!!! She really cares about
           her job and puts a lot of effort into it, and the pictures turn out beautiful.</p>

            <p>Raya Esplin is a true artist. Her work is fantastic, highly recommended. She's creative, original, and her
            pictures are so fun. She'll make you feel like a movie star.</p>
